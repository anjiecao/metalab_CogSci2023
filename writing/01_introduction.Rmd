In the first three years of life, children undergo a plethora of developmental changes, transitioning from newborn infants who possess a limited understanding of language and categories to toddlers who are able to master a wide range of linguistic and cognitive skills. Despite a wealth of research examining cognitive development, constructing a comprehensive theory of cognitive development remains a formidable challenge. Research in this area generally falls under two categories: research that aims to document child development holistically, and research that focuses on investigating specific psychological constructs. The former tends to be observational studies, using instruments like the Bayley Scales to capture an individual child’s development [e.g. @bayley2006bayley]. However, this approach poses a challenge to move from global developmental milestones to underlying mechanisms. In contrast, the latter often uses experiments to allow causal traction on the potential mechanisms of one single construct, but it is often difficult to reveal the connections between different processes and mechanisms. 

In this paper, we aim to provide a quantitative synthesis of experimental work across multiple areas of developmental psychology, providing insights into the interrelatedness between psychological constructs. We achieve this goal by consolidating and integrating 23 meta-analyses of cognitive and language development compiled on MetaLab, a community-augmented meta-analysis platform [@bergmann2018promoting]. 

Statistical meta-analysis, the technique of aggregating effect sizes across a systematic sample of experiments, has unique advantages as a source of data about developmental processes. First, it allows researchers to explore questions that are difficult to address with individual studies. One such example is the functional form of developmental curves, or how different psychological processes change over time. Many developmental studies use linear regression models with age as a predictor, but this assumption of linearity may not capture the complexities of developmental processes. For example, some cognitive abilities –  such as relational reasoning – might follow an inverted-U shape [@carstensen2019context; @walker2016early], while others – like early vocabulary size – show an exponential increase [@frank2021variability]. These non-linear trends can be challenging to identify and interpret with limited data from individual studies, but meta-analytic methods can provide a large amount of data across a broad age range, enabling researchers to evaluate and compare different functional forms of developmental trajectories.

Meta-analysis can also shed light on how research methods influence the strengths of observed effects. Research methods and theories are fundamentally intertwined, and this is especially true for developmental psychology, in which even small changes to the methods could substantially change the outcomes [@dale2022fundamental]. One example is the influence of familiarization time. It has been proposed that the amount of exposure infants have prior to the test events can influence infants’ direction of preference [i.e. novelty preference or familiarity preference, @hunter1988multifactor]. Although the empirical evidence for this theory is mixed, this ambiguity has significant downstream consequences on our understanding of infants’ cognitive capabilities [@bergmann2016development; Cf. @black2017quantifying]. Debates about infants’ arithmetic competence or their evaluations of social agents are often centered around the direction of preferences [Infants arithmetic competence: @clearfield2006familiarization; @wakeley2000can; @wynn1992addition; Evaluation of social agents:@hamlin2007social; @salvadori2015probing]. Due to the time and resources required for developmental studies, it is often difficult to directly evaluate the impact of subtle changes in methods. Therefore, meta-analytic methods provide a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of methodological factors on research findings.

Last but not least, meta-analytic methods make it possible to compare and connect research findings across research areas.  The use of effect size as the fundamental unit of analysis allows for comparisons across different domains and research areas, and it can help us answer questions such as whether mutual exclusivity facilitates the process of syntactic bootstrapping [@cao2022quantifying; @lewis2016quantitative]. However, a synthesis across multiple domains requires a database of multiple meta-analyses. Towards that aim, MetaLab was established to provide an open database of meta-analyses [@bergmann2018promoting]. Developmental researchers are invited to deposit their meta-analysis dataset into MetaLab, and they are encouraged to use the datasets for custom analyses. As of January 2023, Metalab contains 2,497 effect sizes from 30 different meta-analyses. This resource allows the beginnings of a quantitative synthesis across different research areas in developmental psychology. 

In particular, we address three questions. First, we investigate the shape of developmental curves across domains. The form of growth curves has been of interest in a lot of areas of developmental research [e.g., accelerating growth in vocabulary: @mcmurray2007defusing; asymptotic decreases in reaction time: @kail1991developmental]. These nuanced descriptions of developmental trajectories allow for a more precise understanding of the mechanisms driving these changes. We aim to provide these quantitative descriptions for more research areas. Second, we hope to understand how research methods moderate the strengths of the findings. Increasingly, developmental research methods are scrutinized for their mechanisms and scientific rigor [@paulus2022should; @stahl2022great]. With MetaLab, the field is ripe for a more systematic understanding of how different design choices in experiments could influence the results. Finally, we offer a birds-eye view of the field by integrating the growth curves across multiple domains. This view would provide an empirical foundation for creating a synthesized theory of cognitive development.
